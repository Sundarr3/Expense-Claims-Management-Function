# Expense Claims Management Function

## Overview
This project includes the implementation of a PostgreSQL function named `get_all_expense_claims`. This function is designed to retrieve and manage expense claims for employees within an organization, leveraging PL/pgSQL to enforce role-based access control and provide a comprehensive data retrieval mechanism.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures only authorized users can view expense claims.
- **Dynamic Querying**: Retrieves expense claims based on user privileges and specified employee IDs.
- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: Fetches detailed information about each expense claim, including employee details, submission dates, and approval statuses.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling and logging for administrative review.

## Function Signature
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_all_expense_claims(
    p_login_emp_id integer,
    p_employee_id integer,
    OUT p_return_id integer,
    OUT p_message character varying,
    OUT all_expense_claims refcursor
) RETURNS record
```

## Parameters
- `p_login_emp_id`: The employee ID of the user attempting to access the claims.
- `p_employee_id`: The employee ID for which the expense claims are being queried.
- `p_return_id`: An output parameter indicating the success or failure of the operation.
- `p_message`: An output parameter containing a success or error message.
- `all_expense_claims`: A cursor that returns the retrieved expense claims.

## Usage
