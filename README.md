# Expense Claims Management Function

## Overview
The **Expense Claims Management Function** is a PostgreSQL function designed to retrieve and manage expense claims for employees within an organization. It leverages PL/pgSQL for dynamic querying and enforces role-based access control to ensure secure data access.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to authorized users only.
- **Dynamic Querying**: Retrieves expense claims based on user permissions and specified employee IDs.
- **Comprehensive Data Retrieval**: Provides detailed information on expense claims, including employee details, submission dates, and approval statuses.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error logging for administrative review.

## Function Signature
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_all_expense_claims(
    p_login_emp_id integer,
    p_employee_id integer,
    OUT p_return_id integer,
    OUT p_message character varying,
    OUT all_expense_claims refcursor
) RETURNS record
```

### Parameters
- `p_login_emp_id`: Employee ID of the user attempting to access the claims.
- `p_employee_id`: Employee ID for which the expense claims are being queried.
- `p_return_id`: Output parameter indicating success (1) or failure (0).
- `p_message`: Output parameter containing success or error message.
- `all_expense_claims`: Cursor that returns the retrieved expense claims.
