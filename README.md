# Expense-Claims-Management-Function
This project includes the implementation of a PostgreSQL function named get_all_expense_claims, designed to retrieve and manage expense claims for employees within an organization. The function leverages PL/pgSQL to provide a robust interface for querying expense claims while enforcing role-based access control.
